# Bitovi's Continous Exploration Pattern

This is a sample project that shows how to progress medium to large inititives (feature ideas) into:

- Prioritized
- Estimated, and
- Efficiently deliverable 

workstreams.

## Workflow

You can see an example `Free Fanny Pack` initiative being filled out across different stages in the workflow in this repo's [Program Initiatives project](https://github.com/bitovi/continous-exploration/projects/1).

The workflow steps (and matching example initiative) are as follows:

- __Unrefined__ - [fanny pack example](https://github.com/bitovi/continous-exploration/issues/7) - Raw ideas
- __Has requirements__ - [fanny pack example](https://github.com/bitovi/continous-exploration/issues/1) - User-centric requirements, wireframe, out-of-scope features.
- __Has estimate__ - [fanny pack example](https://github.com/bitovi/continous-exploration/issues/2) - Work breakdown and development cost estimation.
- __Has evaluation__ - [fanny pack example](https://github.com/bitovi/continous-exploration/issues/6) - Value proven and/or estimated.

Each one of the `fanny pack example` issues above includes an example of the work in that stage and an answers the following questions about that stage:

- What is the purpose of that stage?
- How to move an initiative into that stage?
- How to sort that stage?

## Background

This pattern is inspired by [Scaled Agile's Continous Exploration process](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/continuous-exploration/) and Bitovi's work over the past several years. It's a more stakeholder-driven workflow than the more agile `Observe > Hypothesize > Validate > Develop > Validate` methods that Bitovi prefers.
