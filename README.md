# Bitovi's Continous Exploration Pattern

This is a sample project that shows how to progress medium to large inititives (feature ideas) into:

- Prioritized
- Estimated, and
- Efficiently deliverable 

workstreams.

## Workflow

You can see an example `Free Fanny Pack` initiative being filled out across different stages in the workflow in this repo's [Program Initiatives project](https://github.com/bitovi/continous-exploration/projects/1).

The workflow steps (and matching example initiative) are as follows:

- __Unrefined__ - [fanny pack example](https://github.com/bitovi/continous-exploration/issues/7) - Raw ideas
- __Has requirements__ - [fanny pack example](https://github.com/bitovi/continous-exploration/issues/1) - User-centric requirements, wireframe, out-of-scope features.
- __Has estimate__ - [fanny pack example](https://github.com/bitovi/continous-exploration/issues/2) - Work breakdown and development cost estimation.
- __Has evaluation__ - [fanny pack example](https://github.com/bitovi/continous-exploration/issues/6) - Value proven and/or estimated.
