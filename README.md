# Bitovi's Continous Exploration Pattern

This is a sample project that shows how to progress medium to large inititives (feature ideas) into:

- Prioritized
- Estimated, and
- Efficiently deliverable 

workstreams.

## Workflow

You can see an example `Free Fanny Pack` initiative being filled out across different stages in the workflow in this repo's [Program Initiatives project](https://github.com/bitovi/continous-exploration/projects/1).

The workflow steps (and matching example initiative) are as follows:

- __Unrefined__ - [fanny pack example](https://github.com/bitovi/continous-exploration/issues/7) - Raw ideas
- __Has requirements__ - [fanny pack example](https://github.com/bitovi/continous-exploration/issues/1) - User-centric requirements, wireframe, out-of-scope features.
- __Has estimate__ - [fanny pack example](https://github.com/bitovi/continous-exploration/issues/2) - Work breakdown and development cost estimation.
- __Has evaluation__ - [fanny pack example](https://github.com/bitovi/continous-exploration/issues/6) - Value proven and/or estimated.

Each one of the `fanny pack example` issues above includes an example of the work in that stage and an answers the following questions about that stage:

- What is the purpose of that stage?
- How to move an initiative into that stage?
- How to sort that stage?

## Background

This pattern is inspired by [Scaled Agile's Continous Exploration process](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/continuous-exploration/) and Bitovi's work over the past several years. The pattern outlined here a more stakeholder-driven workflow than the more agile `Observe > Hypothesize > Validate > Develop > Validate` methods that Bitovi prefers. However, most companies are still strongly stakeholder led. So this workflow works very well for those organizations.

Example of a more agile workflow:

![Pure Continous Exploration](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vRG_Eiduu9xIWeSbWa_xWY-yf9qVcCeEP8aFJvaFWmfKEEBDHhRRRBzpGaYt6mA03m273ujU8qs3QQ8/pub?w=500)

![Continous Exploration With Stakeholders](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vQ0zOne0Um6B6HR1lExc-mG5AncvPtm4jOJihHStDPSQZZ1sW1WFYtDiQq7DE_n6FP1Vv6b0Q4GvHhK/pub?w=500)


## Operation

Most of this work can be done by two groups of individuals:

- Stakeholders
- Project Manager (PM) - aka Product Owner (PO) or Technical Product Owner (TPO)

We recommend that this work is done continously. This means that these initiatives are being _filled out_ and _reprioritized_ each sprint. The results of that effort are also being shared with the larger team each sprint.

<summary> Comparison to Scaled Agile's PI Planning events </summary>

This is in contrast to Scaled Agile's [PI Planning](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/pi-planning/) where everyone meets face to face for multiple days each quarter.
While many organizations like this approach, Bitovi finds it extremely inneficient less effective than the continous approach for several reasons:

- It doesn't leave time for validation of ideas. Work is planned in one big-bang and then executed.
- It doesn't provide time for digestion and thoughtfulness. People think better when given time to digest, think, and research.  
- It doesn't operate in the day-to-day outputs that teams use.  A paper board needs to be turned into a digital representation. This means that when changes to the plan do occur, people need to adjust the day-to-day representations of work.  They are operating in 2 different systems instead of one.
- It doesn't work well for remote teams. You can't easily "break out" online like you can in-person.
- It requires a huge amount of preperation to be prepared for _all_ work for a 3 month time period.  

That being said, PI planning is great for team building.
